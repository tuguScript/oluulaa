The purpose of Oluulaa is to connect and empower young Mongolians in the San Francisco Bay Area through events that focus on person and professional growth. 

With this mission, in 2018, we are proud to have organized total of seven events reaching 3,500 people (attendees and live stream viewers). 

We are recapping Oluulaaâ€™s 2018 highlights with this video. Thank you for your support! 

We are happy to share that we are expanding our team and have much planned for 2019! If you would like to show your [support to Oluulaa](https://www.oluulaa.io/#donation)
